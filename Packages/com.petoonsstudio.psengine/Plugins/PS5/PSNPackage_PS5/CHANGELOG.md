## [0.0.27-preview] - 2022-01-04

### Changed
   - Changed how the recipients of a `SendGameSessionMessageRequest` and `SendPlayerSessionMessageRequest` are specified.  The recipients of the messages are now specified using a new structure `SessionMemberIdentifier`, containing both the account id and the platform of the recipient.  Previously it was just the account id, and the recipients were assumed to be on PS5.  This change fixes a bug where messages sent to session members who were on PS4 would fail to send.  This is a breaking change that requires corresponding alterations to users' code.
   - Added ExceededMaximumOperations exception to all Schedule() calls. This occurs if too many operations are waiting in the work queue. This catches issues where a title is flooding the queue with more work than it can safely process.
   - Improved example of RecordScoreRequest in sample. Sample now better explains what happens when the request has a SCE_NP_WEBAPI_SERVER_ERROR_LEADERBOARDS_LARGE_DATA_EXCEEDS_NUMBER_LIMIT error.
   - Removed "Get Group Info (0)" button from sample as 'Group 0' doesn't exist and it was creating an error message.

### Fixed
   - Error in UploadDataRequest which caused a random crash due to incorrect data serialization.

## [0.0.26-preview] - 2021-11-23

### Added
   - Added support for SDK 4.0

### Added
   - Added support for SDK 3.0

## [0.0.23-preview] - 2021-02-23

### Added
   - GameSessionJoinState to SessionMember for game session members. This replaces the IsReserved property.
   - Support for Representative data added to GameSession and RetrievedSessionData. 
   - Handler for "psn:sessionManager:gs:representative:updated" added to game session notification update callback.
   - New 'Start UDS' button added to Trophy menu in sample app to aid in unlocking trophies.
   - Error messages during start-up if any of the modules fail to load or initialization fails.

### Changed
   - Replaced UnlockTrophyProgressRequest with UpdateTrophyProgressRequest. UnlockTrophyProgressRequest has been marked as obsolete.
   - Removed the IsReserved property from SessionMember and replaced it with enum GameSessionJoinState.
   - SessionFilters in PlayerSession and GameSession requests now use a static instance of PlayerSessionFilters or GameSessionFilters. This shares the same set of filters with all the players WebApiPushEvent that join the session. This helps reduce the number of resources allocated by session. This default behaviour can be changed by assigning any custom filter set to the SessionFilters property. 
   - Sample now has improved handling of off-line users and handles user logging into PSN while the sample is running. 

### Fixed
   - JoinGameSessionRequest now uses correct GameSession.SessionWebApiEventHandler instead of PlayerSession.SessionWebApiEventHandler.
   - JoinGameSessionRequest incorrectly initialised SessionFilters to use PlayerSessionFilters. Fixed to now use GameSessionFilters.
   - The Joined or Reserved state of a game session member is now correctly updated when RetrievedSessionData is applied to a GameSession. 
   - WebApiPushEvent created for each user joining a PlayerSession or GameSession are now released automatically when the player leaves that session.

### Changed

This can now be called before a user is registered with the system (AddUserRequest). If a user is signed in but not registered with the system it will return CRStatus.SignedInNotRegistered. If this occurs add the user, using AddUserRequest, then call GetCommunicationRestrictionStatusRequest to get the Restricted or Unrestricted state. If AddUserRequest is called on a user not signed up or signed in for PSN then it will fail to create the internal contexts required by the various PSN libraries.
