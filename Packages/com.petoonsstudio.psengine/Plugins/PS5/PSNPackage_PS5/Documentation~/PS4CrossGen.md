# Add the PS4 Cross-Gen SDK to your Unity project

The PlayStation 4 (PS4) Cross-Gen Software Development Kit (SDK) enables you to add PlayStation 5 (PS5) network functionality to a PS4 game, allowing for cross-generation networking between PS4 and PS5 players while playing your PS4 game and vice versa. The SDK provides APIs for PS5 network features such as multiplayer, social platform, commerce platform, and data platform. For more information about the features that are included, see[ Cross-Generation SDK](https://p.siedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/4.000/Cross_Generation-Overview/0003.html) .
