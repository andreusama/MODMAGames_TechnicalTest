# Add Activities to your PS5 Unity Project

After downloading and setting up the PlayStation Network package, you must create at least one Activity, as detailed in the [technical requirements checklist](https://p.siedev.net/resources/documents/TRC/2021.02/TRC/R5301.html), for your PlayStation 5 (PS5) game. An Activity is a unit of gameplay that is essential to the structure of a game. Example Activities include levels, quests, or multiplayer modes. 

The PlayStation Network package enables developers to expose individual Activities to players outside of a game as PS5 system cards. You can add handling for each Activity card using the Game Intent system so that the player is taken to the relevant part of the game the card represents. To learn more about the Game Intent system see [Multiplayer Platform Concept Overview](https://p.siedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/4.000/PSN_Multiplayer_Platform_Concept-Overview/multiplayer-platform.html).
