# Add an npconfig.zip file to your Unity project

To build your PS5 Unity project with PlayStation Network features, you must add a `npconfig.zip` to your projectâ€™s **Publishing Settings**. The `npconfig.zip` is a file generated by Sony that stores required networking data for your PS5 game so that when you run the game the PS5 system is aware of your network IDs and configuration. If you do not specify a file when trying to build for PS5, Unity provides a test one for you.

To add the npconfig.zip file to your Unity project, follow the steps below: 

1. Download the npconfig.zip file from [GEMS](https://tools.partners.playstation.net/gems-tool), the PlayStation package management tool. <br/> For guidance, follow the procedure in [Package Disk Management Tool (GEMS) Overview](https://p.siedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/5.000/Package_Disc_Management_Tool_GEMS-Overview/__document_toc.html) on DevNet.
2. In Unity, open the **Player Settings** window (menu: **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Player**).
3. Select the **PS5** platform.
4. Go to **Publishing** **Settings** > **PlayStation Network**.
5. Select **Package metadata file (npconfig.zip)** to open a file explorer window.  
6. Choose the `npconfig.zip` file from your file system.
