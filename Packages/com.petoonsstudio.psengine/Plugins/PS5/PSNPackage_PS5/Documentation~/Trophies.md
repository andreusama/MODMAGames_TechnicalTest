# Add Trophies to your PS5 Unity project

After adding the PlayStation Network package to your PS5 project, you must create Trophies for your game using the Universal Data System service.

Unity supports the use of Trophies in PlayStation 5 (PS5) projects as part of the PlayStation Network package. Trophies are a required element of a PS5 application that reward users for completing objectives within a game. Trophies a player earns - through achieving objectives like completing levels, completing tasks or collecting items - are displayed on their profile. 

For more information about the Trophies concept, see the [PS5 Trophy System Overview](https://p.siedev.net/resources/documents/SDK/latest/Trophy_System-Overview/0001.html#__document_toc_00000000) on DevNet.
